# Hand Tracking LED Control with STM32

A real-time hand tracking system built using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe**, which sends commands over **UART** to an STM32 microcontroller to control LEDs.  
This project demonstrates how computer vision can interact with embedded hardware in a simple and effective way.

## ✨ Features
- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe  
- Detects fingertip position and checks box intersections  
- Sends `'R'`, `'B'`, `'Y'` commands to STM32 through UART (115200 baud)  
- STM32 toggles LEDs on PC2, PC3, and PA10  
- Stable communication at **3 Hz**  
- Clean and lightweight Python + STM32 implementation  

---

## 🖥️ PC / Python Side

The computer vision application is implemented in `main.py`.

### Technologies used:
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe  
- PySerial  

### How it works:
- The camera detects your hand and tracks your index fingertip.
- When your finger enters a colored box, the script sends a UART character:
  - **Blue Box → `'B'`**
  - **Yellow Box → `'Y'`**
  - **Red Box → `'R'`**

## 🔧 STM32 Side (Firmware)

The STM32 code listens for UART characters using interrupt mode:

- `'R'` toggles **PC3**  
- `'B'` toggles **PC2**  
- `'Y'` toggles **PA10**  

This logic is implemented inside:


The firmware immediately re-enables UART interrupt reception so the board continuously listens.

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ Python Side
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyserial
python main.py

### 2️⃣ STM32 Side
- Flash the provided `main.c` (or full project) to your STM32 board  
- Make sure UART pins match your setup  
- Baud rate: **115200**

## 🔌 Hardware Requirements
- STM32 development board (ex: STM32F103, STM32F401, Nucleo etc.)  
- USB-UART connection (or virtual COM via STLink)  
- 3× LED + resistors

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Gesture recognition instead of fingertip position  
- Wireless communication (Bluetooth / WiFi)  
- Controlling servos or motors  
- Multi-hand support
